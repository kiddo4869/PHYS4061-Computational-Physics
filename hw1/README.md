## Features

- Calculate the integration
- Calculate the squared deviation from the true value 

## Requirements

- C++ compiler

## Usage

1. Compile the program:
   g++ Integration.cpp -o Integration

2. Run the program:
   ./Integration

3. Input the no. of slices N (or no. of sample points M):
   e.g.
   Please input the no. of slices (or no. of sample points): 1000
